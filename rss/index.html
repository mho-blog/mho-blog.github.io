The essence of this book is to inspire readers to document, display and share their work for the world to see, and this book is a major inspiration for this blog. To summarise what I have learnt so far -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Beginners, fret not.</strong></p>
<p>The author starts of by dismissing the number one fear most of us have when we think about putting our work out there for the world to see. Most of us think that there is no audience for amateurs or beginners. We fail to realise that we don&apos;t have to be perfect, or even mediocre, to start documenting our work. There is usually an audience out there who are interesting in exactly the same kind of areas you are interested in, you just have to put yourself and your work out there to find them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Process &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Product.</strong></p>
<p>The community surrounding whatever craft it is that you are into, be it technology, art, writing, blogging, investing, or anything else under the sun, is much more interested in the process of learning and sharing ideas amongst each other rather than merely admiring finished products. These communities are much more usefull not as an audience, but as a teacher. So, the author clearly elaborates on how we should focus on sharing the process. They will lead to productive conversations and innovation. <strong>The journey, the process, is far more valuable to the world than the destination or a finished masterpeice.</strong></p>
